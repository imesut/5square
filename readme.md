# All Square

This is a project for Square Hackathon.

Square is more than a payment provider, they're positioning themself as businesses' operating system.

Square provides online sales channels, in-app payment solutions, staff management and more.

Square generally develops B2B solutions. With this project we wished to touch with a B2C solution to Square's direct and indirect customers. Business powered by Square, can create an online presence. So businesses can join to a chatbot (the 5Quare) developed and managed by Square.

Thanks to Square's centralizing power, businesses can get some benefits as below;

1. Better discoverability by being listed in chatbot
1. Offering a new and accessible way of placing orders through chatbot interface
1. Reach to a bigger user base, by removing the need of installing an app
1. Reaching to customer data, which makes easy to contact them and offer discounts, loyalty program, in summary reasons to revisit the venue
